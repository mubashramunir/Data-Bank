# Introduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged
digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these
new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decided to launch a
new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking
activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage
platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to
how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting
caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank
team needs your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer
base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their
customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the
business analyze their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their
future developments!

# Available Data

The Data Bank team have prepared a data model for this case study as well as
a few example rows from the complete dataset below to get you familiar with
their tables.

# Table 1: Regions

Just like popular cryptocurrency platforms - Data Bank is also run off a
network of nodes where both money and data is stored across the globe. In a
traditional banking sense - you can think of these nodes as bank branches or
stores that exist around the world.

This regions table contains the region_id and their respective region_name
value

# Table 2: Customer Nodes

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their
region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and
data.

This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers
getting into Data Bank’s system and stealing customer’s money and data!
Below is a sample of the top 10 rows of the data_bank.customer_nodes

# Table 3: Customer Transactions

This table stores all customer deposits, withdrawals and purchases made
using their Data Bank debit card.

# Interactive SQL Instance

Serious SQL students will have access to the same relevant schema SQL and
example solutions which they can use with their Docker setup from within the
course player!

# Case Study Questions
The following case study questions include some general data exploration
analysis for the nodes and transactions before diving right into the core
business questions and finishing with a challenging final request!
